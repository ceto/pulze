</h2>
      <p>Pulze is an in-house development of Brick Visual. Due to the ever higher number of workstations and and thus the difficulty managing the render node distribution, we had to find a way to organise and control render jobs. After more than one year of testing it in production, it is now a core element of our pipeline. Because of its real necessity and efficiency, we decided to go public and share this tool with everybody having similar needs. If you are interested, and would like to try Pulze, please sign up for the beta test, and we will get in touch with you.</p>
      <p>Pulze is a render farm manager and monitor software. Its two main parts are the Client and the Server. Pulze’s main feature is its Reserve’n’Render approach which means that* the user can reserve a number nodes for himself. Please check the Client and the Server features for more information.</p>
      <p><em><small>*node demand can be scheduled, thus maximizing the capacity of the farm</small></em></p>

            <h3 class="bullet__title">Node vs Workstation</h3>
            <p>Pulze Client has two running modes. By default, it starts in ‘node mode’ which means that it can be reserved and used for jobs. Once you register or login with your username, you will be switched to ‘workstation mode’ where you can create jobs. This option allows all PCs to be render nodes or a workstations - depending on the current needs. When Pulze starts it scans the node or the workstation for supported apps, thus preventing you from sending jobs to nodes that are not compatible with your job settings.</p>

            <h3 class="bullet__title">Rules</h3>
            <p>Rules are the heart of Pulze. If it is enabled, users can only reserve a fix amount of nodes for their jobs. You can have multiple rules during the day depending on your needs. You can create or edit rules on the server side.</p>

            <h3 class="bullet__title">Job Creation</h3>
            <p>Creating a job only takes 3 steps. Select your job type, application and the number of nodes you wish to use. You can choose from 3 types of jobs: Distributed, Animation and Infinite. Infinite is a special type because it lets you reserve nodes for any other type of task without any limitation from the current rule. After selecting your application name, version and render engine, Pulze by default will only select the free nodes that are compatible with your job settings. Naturally, you can also override this selection manually, and choose nodes that are Inactive or Rendering. After a job is created, Pulze will automatically start the required spawner if it is not running already.</p>

            <h3 class="bullet__title">Job Monitoring</h3>
            <p>By selecting a job, you can get more information about it, like when it was created, when it will end, which application and engine is it using. Also with one click you can go to the project folder or the output folder, if it is provided.</p>

            <h3 class="bullet__title">Connector</h3>
            <p>Another smart feature of Pulze is after you create a Distributed job, you don't need to setup anything else just hit render. For every application a Connector script is installed which will communicate with the client and it will automatically change your job status.</p>

                <h3 class="bullet__title seccol">Nodes</h3>
                <p>The node management on the server side has a few extra features. It lists all the connected nodes and workstations with their client version, username and current status. You can switch the selected workstations to node-mode remotely, enabling them to be used in a job. Another handy feature is to transfer any node or workstation to another running server which can save you a lot of time rather than doing it manually one by one.</p>

                <h3 class="bullet__title seccol">Rules</h3>
                <p>On the server side you can create and edit rules. It is possible to set the maximum number of nodes to be reserved and their timeout (that is the time that you have before and after your render). Once your timevalue expires, your job will be automatically deleted and the nodes will become free (only applies for Distributed jobs). You can also set a timeframe for your rules: for example you can have different rules for working hours Monday to Friday and for nights and weekends. Additionally, you can set a higher node count for peak-times in your office.</p>
